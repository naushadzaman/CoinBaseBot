Twilio python API was giving some stupid error, like number not valid. Didn't have the patience to debug it through. Hacky way to handle it with curl. Update Token, SID, Message url and parameters appropriately to get notification. Otherwise comment out send_text request.

## Next ToDO
* Integrate to buy / sell directly instead of just notifications. Coinbase put a 48 hrs wait time to enable account. Gdax could be used as well. 
* Predict crypto currency price from other ones, e.g. predict Litecoin price from Bitcoin and Litecoin historic + ETH current and historic + gold current and historic
* If the price is in free falling or continuous upwards 
* Get recent transactions to get a sense of what's going on
